# try_pytorch
Simple classification network in PyTorch, developed for getting familiar with PyTorch and to be used as template for future PyTorch work.

This code is strongly base on the "Neural Networks in PyTorch" extracurricular module of the [Udacity Deep Reinforncement Learning Nanodegree](https://eu.udacity.com/course/deep-reinforcement-learning-nanodegree--nd893).
The original github repository for the module can be found [here](https://github.com/udacity/DL_PyTorch).
